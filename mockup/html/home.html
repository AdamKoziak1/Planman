    <h1 >What is PlanMan?</h1>
    <p>PlanMan is an online project management software. It is structured around projects, and tasks within those
        projects. Each project and tasks has goals which need to be reached before completion. Tasks can be split up
        into smaller and smaller nested subclasses for organization purposes. Users can add attachments to projects, as
        well as control who has access to them. The program uses an algorithm based on urgency and remaining time to
        show you the next task you should finish.</p>
